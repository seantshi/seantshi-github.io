summary: An App made for ICS students to create study sessions and cram.
---


Cram is an app designed to encourage ICS students to create study sessions and cram together.  We worked in a group of four using Meteor to launch the app and Github to collaborate between us.  Html was used for the front-end of the app, and Mongodb was used for the back-end.

Through out the development of this application, we used Github's issues tab to work out what else needs to be done along with milestones to keep us on track.  There is a lot more we could have done with this application, but it was a good experience.
