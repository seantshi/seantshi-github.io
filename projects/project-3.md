In 2012 when I was in Boyscouts, I did my Eagle Project to become an Eagle Scout.  I noticed that there was a ditch infront of the school gym that could be potentially dangerous if cars didn't see it when they were parking during school events.  So I installed bright yellow reflective poles at the top of the ditch to prevent any future accidents.

This project involved a lot of planning and required me to be a leader to instruct people accordingly and keep everyone on track.  From this I learned that major projects requires a lot of management and forsight in time, cost, size and manpower.
