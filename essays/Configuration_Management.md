<h2>Github</h2>

Throughout my academic career, I have used Github quite frequently to share and collaborate on projects.  File sharing with multiple people is a very necessary thing, and Github has been very useful for that.  When I first started, it took me awhile to get used to the things Github requires before you can share or receive files, but after learning about it more and experiencing why those things are in place, I have become more grateful for Github.

Before I wondered why I wouldn't be able to get updated files from my group members without saving my changes first, but that was for the best since reverting unwanted changes that broke the program was quite frequent and helpful.  Seeing all the changes on a timeline and picking which version to sync to is vital for file sharing, and github's version is simple and user friendly compared to other file sharing methods.
