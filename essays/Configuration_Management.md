Configuration Management is a key part in cooperation and team management in computer science.  Major projects are going to require many people working together and having everyone be on the same page with the same code is important for that.

GitHub is useful for that since files can be easily shared and edited by many people all at once.  Something simular to this that I have used in the past is Google Docs, but for massive files load time and lag made it slower than just working offline.  With Github and git there is the lagless speed when editing while maintaining the cooperation aspect that is required for group projects.

I feel like the need for filesharing for groups created the need for something like git, and since Github is so user friendly, and easy to access it with no external downloads, it makes the advantages of git more accessable to anyone even if they are using it for their first time.  In my opinion Github is popular because of how simple and accessable it is while doing it's job perfectly.  Git might be the thing running Github, but I believe that if Github was harder to learn and less accessable to everyone then it would be much less popular.
