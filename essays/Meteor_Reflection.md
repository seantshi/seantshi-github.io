Like anything else new, using Meteor for the first time took some getting used to.  There is an adjustment period where everything is both new and confusing.  Without earlier experience with something similar its very hard to get anything done effectively or quickly.

Just loading up the example app for meteor took a lot of guesswork and reasearch, and the long load times for initial boots are still something that I'm getting used to, but the easy creation of apps makes the wait seem worth it.  After inital booting, testing html files that implement javascript code is as easy as waiting for meteor to sync everything again.  Theres no need to compile each file after every edit or link all the files up, Meteor does that already making app design quick and easy aside from the initial wait time.

In any case, halfway through learing the basics of meteor, my laptop crashed and I had to get a new one.  It helped me realize that everything we learn builds upon each other since I had to redownload all the past programs we worked with in order to get meteor to work.  Meteor uses a combination of both html and javascript, so I will have to have a solid understanding of the past in order to progress in the future.
