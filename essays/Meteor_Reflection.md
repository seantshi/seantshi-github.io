Html is used to build many different types of web pages in a quick and simple way. Formatting html webpages are made easier with css stylesheets and Semantic UI makes styling even easier. With css, different parts of the page can be set to a certain style by changing it's class, and with Semantic UI different classes and styles are made available from the start allowing web design and formatting to be quicker and easier to get to.

The amount of customization in Semantic Ui's library means that webpages can be set to be whatever style the designer needs while remaining simple and easy to understand for anyone to get it in a matter of minutes. Making a grid is as simple as adding the class "ui grid" to a div. Customizing that grid is as easy as saying "ui three column grid container" if you want the grid to contain 3 columns.

In addition to helping with simple formatting and classes with Semantic Ui, many different icons are made available to help jumpstart any webpage with the necessary icons like email, facebook and various social media links. All can be added simply by using and setting it's class to "search icon" or whatever icon you need. Many of them are easy to get like mail icon so really easy to set up a page with lots of links really quick with Semantic Ui.
