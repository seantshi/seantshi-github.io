Coding standards is an important yet controversial part of any computer scientist’s daily life.  Everyone has their own preference that affects how comprehensible each code is.  Enforcing a coding standard is great for breaking bad habits if they happen to develop but at the risk of frustrating the coder and possibly making even simple tasks take longer.

For this past week, we switched from jsfiddle to Intellij.  This was a huge change since jsfiddle was a web based code editor that took one second to load up and start working and Intellij was a much more complex code editor that was faster and had more features, but setting it up and using it took more time.  Changing all the settings and disabling all the unnecessary plug-ins was the difficult but I believe in the long run that initial change will be worth it.

Intellij has a lot more features than jsfiddle, the most important one seems like it’ll be using multiple files all at once where as jsfiddle could only have one file active.  I don’t think I’d be able to load javascript scripts in an html page with jsfiddle, but with Intellij seems very possible.  Getting used to the coding standards in ESlint also seems difficult since I’m so used to double quotes and putting the curly brackets on the next line, but like the transition from jsfiddle to Intellij I believe that this difficult change will be worth my time.
